- License issues.
  - Can we distribute libpardiso with the package or must each user
    download it by themself? 
  - User-spesific license file we presume?
  - Win-build with gcc/gfortran?
  - Can all use of R-INLA be classified as 'academic' ? 

- Can we get an access to reordering/permutation? Statistical models
  often have a set of nodes neigbours to many. METIS has an option to
  order these last, but this is option is default off. How is this set
  in PARDISO or can it be changed?

- All matrices that we'll use pardiso for, is SPD. mtype=2 does not
  'work'. In the current version (6.1 and 5) the partial inverse is
  not returned, and the log-determinat are set to 0.

- How to get access to the diagonal matrix D in LDL^T factorization
  for mtype=-2? we need that in order to emulate party solve of 'LL^T'
  for SPD.

- Can we obtain a copy 'void *pt[64]' ? if yes, will different pt's be
  thread-safe?

- We also need to solve ()x=b with not from 1..n, but from i..j, as we
  know the zero-pattern of the RHS. Is there any way this can added?
